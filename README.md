  - I was able to talk to a discord server member (Kyota [repo @Kyota-exe]) today, he discussed with me about beginning my journey in OS (Operating System) development.
  
*7/28/2022 10:42 AM* - I began learning about Multithreading.
  - I made a repo for my multithreading journey. This will help me keep track and try to accomplish something every now and again to fully understand multithreading.

*11/11/2024 10:16 PM* - Learning about Operating Systems
  - It has been a long time since I learned anything about coding. However, I felt a passion to learn it again. I am not going to be soley focused on it, as I want to learn
  - various things like operating systems, x86 ASM, and information in automotives. I will use this page to highlight important moments.
